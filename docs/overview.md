# Trading Portolio and Tools
## Normal Positions
We can count as "normal" a position in a coin/token that is bought held away and sold eventually in whole or part

There are some special cases like exchanges but those can
be seen as sell this, buy that from proceeds transaction pairs.

## Staked and AutStacked Positions
Some or all of some token may be staked.
The staking will effectively pay dividends. 
The dividends may be paid in the coin staked or some other coin.
The dividends may be autostaked or compopounded in or not.

### DeFI 2.0 variation
Here we have a primary coin and we effectively receive more of 
that primary coin per rebase period (typically 8 hours) determined by the rate.
This amount is automatically added to the staked amount.

A good question is how this is modeled for take purposes. It looks more like a dividend in kind or like
a dribbling stock grant than a conventonal buy.  Or perhaps a crypto gift. 
From the POV of coin acounting it looks like a buy at zero cost.
